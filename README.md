Test First Ruby -- RSpec 3 Edition
==========

### Solutions

These are my solutions to the ruby problems from the Odin Project, a web curriculum to learn full-stack web development
with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby and Ruby on Rails. 

In this project, test-driven development is simulated. First, tests should fail, the necessary code should be written,
and the test should then pass.
